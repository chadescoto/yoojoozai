Started following F1 recently, so I wanted to race on the Spanish Circuit to get a better understanding of the track before race day. I was wondering how well the modded maps are made and if there's really a reason to get the Dream Pack for the track alone. So I love the granite gear crown 38, but I wish it had a suspension back like the arc blast, and maybe weighed the same. I'm not totally sold on the arc blast because A: I've never tried one on and B: I'm a huge fan of stretchy mesh pockets. Also C: I think that Velcro would drive me crazy. Required: sub 3 lb, hip belt, roll top closure, external mesh pocket, 38-50 liter capacity. Desired: slimmer profile on back, ice axe loops, not just white or black, semi durable, since I hike primarily.

Hi, there is an offer in which you can buy the game Assetto Corsa + all dream packs and cost you less than buying the 3 dlc¬¥s appart (if you want to see it AC + DLC¬¥s url: https://www.g2a.com/assetto-corsa-dream-packs-steam-key-global-i10000008713004 ) The problem is that i already have Assetto Corsa and i don¬¥t know if when i buy this bundle it would give me only one key with Assetto Corsa + DLC¬¥s or 4 keys so i can easily introduce in my own game this 3 DLC¬¥s and the game key i could. Everytime I look at a best dlc question for assetto Corsa, everyone just says dream pack 1. What if I already have that? Just for reference my favourite car at the moment is the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento on the Monza track. 5 hours played (not many I know, only had it for a day) so I've only managed to shave my time down to 1:49 using an Xbox one controller. Don't worry, I bought a wheel. Heyoo, I started playing not long ago and I was having some trouble understanding how packs work. I mean there is the bonus pack every 7 hours and we can drop silver/gold pack and rarely dream pack. My question is more about the heavy and dream pack. In the shop the heavy pack is more expensive but seem to have more cards and drop. Maybe I just don't get the numbers on the bottom of the description. Can someone enlighten me and eventually guide me in the choice of any pack?

I bought Project CARS around a year ago when it was on sale and I had just purchased a second hand Driving Force GT wheel. I never really played it that much, until last week my interest for racing sims got awaken. I've tried playing pCARS online a lot, however the most amount of players I ever saw in the last week on any server was about 10-15 (half of which left after the race started and they crashed in the first corner) so in reality, I was racing with 5-7 guys at most.
